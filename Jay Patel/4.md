Explain the concept of ensemble learning. Name some ensemble methods.

Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines the predictions of multiple models to create a stronger, more accurate overall model. The main idea is that while individual models (called base learners) may make mistakes, combining their outputs can reduce errors and improve performance — much like how a group’s collective decision is often better than that of a single person. Ensemble methods help improve accuracy, stability, and generalization of machine learning systems.

There are several popular ensemble methods used in practice. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) trains multiple models on random subsets of the training data and averages their predictions; a well-known example is the Random Forest algorithm. Boosting builds models sequentially, where each new model focuses on correcting the errors made by the previous ones; examples include AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. Another approach, stacking, combines different types of models and uses another model (called a meta-learner) to make the final prediction.

In summary, ensemble learning leverages the power of multiple models working together to achieve better results than any single model could on its own. It is widely used in real-world applications like classification, regression, and competition-winning machine learning systems due to its robustness and accuracy.
