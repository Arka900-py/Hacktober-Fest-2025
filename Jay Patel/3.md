What is backpropagation, and how is it used in training neural networks?


Backpropagation is a key learning algorithm used to train neural networks by adjusting their internal parameters (called weights) to minimize prediction errors. It works by comparing the network’s output to the correct answer, calculating the error, and then moving backward through the network to determine how much each neuron contributed to that error. This process allows the network to learn from its mistakes and improve over time.

During training, backpropagation uses a method called gradient descent to update the weights. It computes the gradient (or slope) of the error with respect to each weight and adjusts the weights slightly in the direction that reduces the error. By repeating this process many times across large amounts of data, the network gradually becomes better at making accurate predictions or classifications.

In simple terms, backpropagation is how a neural network “learns.” It fine-tunes the internal connections between neurons based on feedback, similar to how humans learn from trial and error. Without backpropagation, neural networks wouldn’t be able to automatically improve their performance or extract meaningful patterns from data.
