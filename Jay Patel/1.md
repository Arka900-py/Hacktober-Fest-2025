What is a neural network, and how does it mimic the human brain?

A neural network is a computer system designed to recognize patterns and learn from data in a way that loosely mimics how the human brain works. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes, or “neurons,” where each node processes information and passes it along to others. The network typically includes an input layer (which receives data), one or more hidden layers (which process and transform the data), and an output layer (which produces a result, such as a prediction or classification).

Like the human brain, a neural network learns by adjusting the strength of the connections between its neurons, known as weights, based on experience. During training, the network compares its predictions to the correct answers and gradually modifies these weights to minimize errors — a process similar to how people improve through feedback. Over time, the system becomes better at identifying patterns, such as recognizing faces in photos, understanding speech, or predicting trends.

This structure and learning process allow neural networks to perform tasks that once required human intelligence. Although they don’t think or reason as humans do, their ability to detect complex patterns and make accurate predictions makes them fundamental to technologies like image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.
