Explain the concept of activation functions and why they are important.

An activation function is a mathematical rule used in a neural network to determine whether a neuron should be “activated” — that is, whether it should pass its signal to the next layer. After a neuron receives input data and applies weights to it, the activation function processes the result to introduce non-linearity into the model. Without this non-linearity, the network would behave like a simple linear equation and be unable to handle complex relationships in data.

Activation functions are essential because they allow neural networks to learn and represent complex patterns. For example, they enable models to recognize features like edges in an image, tones in speech, or sentiment in text. Common activation functions include the sigmoid (which outputs values between 0 and 1), tanh (which outputs between -1 and 1), and ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), which outputs zero for negative inputs and the input itself for positive values.

In essence, activation functions give neural networks their “intelligence.” They allow the model to approximate real-world phenomena that are not simply linear, helping it make more accurate predictions and decisions. Without activation functions, even a deep network with many layers would act like a single-layer model — limited and unable to learn complex data patterns.
