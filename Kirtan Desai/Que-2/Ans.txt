Question:
How do you know which worker node is consuming more resources across the clusters using kubectl?

Ans:

First, I make sure the cluster has a Metrics Server or any monitoring tool (like Prometheus or Grafana). Without live CPU and memory data, I can’t measure anything.

Once metrics are available, I approach it like checking which machine in a factory is working the hardest.

1) I list all the nodes with their current CPU and memory usage.
This immediately tells me which node is using more resources compared to the rest. I don’t care about exact numbers—I just look for the one with the highest percentage.

2) I focus on that top consumer node.
Now that I know which node is overloaded, I need to know why.

3) I check which applications (pods) are running on that node.
Usually, there will be one or two pods consuming most of the resources. This helps me understand whether it's a normal workload or a misbehaving service.

4) I check the node’s pressure status.
I verify if the node is facing memory pressure, disk pressure, or nearing its pod limit. This helps me decide if the node is temporarily busy or permanently overloaded.

5) If I manage multiple clusters, I simply repeat the same check in each context.
