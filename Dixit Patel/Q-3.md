## 3. How would you implement soft deletes with multiple restore levels (e.g., restore parent with children) in Laravel?

Answer : 

=> Soft Deletes in Laravel

Soft deletes allow you to delete records without permanently removing them from the database.

The deleted_at column is set instead of deleting the row.

You can later restore the record.

Example: Enabling Soft Deletes
    

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletes;

class Post extends Model {
    use SoftDeletes; // Enable soft deletes

    protected $dates = ['deleted_at']; // Optional, for date casting
}


Add a deleted_at column in the migration:

Schema::table('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->softDeletes(); // Adds deleted_at column
});


--------------
Suppose we have Post (parent) and Comment (child):

Parent-Child Relationship

Code :  

class Post extends Model {
    use SoftDeletes;

    public function comments() {
        return $this->hasMany(Comment::class);
    }
}

class Comment extends Model {
    use SoftDeletes;
}

Soft Delete Parent with Children:

$post = Post::find($id);
$post->delete(); // Soft delete parent
$post->comments()->delete(); // Soft delete all related comments
