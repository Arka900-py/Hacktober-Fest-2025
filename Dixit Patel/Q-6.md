## 6. Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.  

- All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters.  
- No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.  

### Example 1

**Input:**  
s = "egg", t = "add"


**Output:**  
true


**Explanation:**  
- Map `'e'` → `'a'`  
- Map `'g'` → `'d'`

### Example 2

**Input:**  
s = "foo", t = "bar"


**Output:**  
false


**Explanation:**  
The strings cannot be made identical as `'o'` would need to map to both `'a'` and `'r'`.

### Example 3

**Input:**  
s = "paper", t = "title"


**Output:**  
true

Answer :

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if:

1.Each character in s can be mapped to a character in t.

2.The mapping preserves order.

3.No two characters in s map to the same character in t (one-to-one mapping).

4.A character can map to itself.

Algorithm

1.Check if s and t have the same length. If not → return false.

2.Initialize two hash maps:

mapST → maps characters from s → t.

mapTS → maps characters from t → s (to ensure one-to-one mapping).

3.Iterate through each character pair (s[i], t[i]):

If s[i] already mapped → check if it maps to t[i]. If not → return false.

If t[i] already mapped → check if it maps to s[i]. If not → return false.

Otherwise, record the mapping.

4.If loop completes → strings are isomorphic → return true.
