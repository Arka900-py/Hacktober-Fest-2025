## 1. What’s the difference between lazy loading, eager loading, and lazy eager loading?  
How can they affect performance?

Answer : 

=> Lazy Loading

Definition:

Loads related models only when you access them.

The query for related data is executed on-demand, not at the time of fetching the main model.

Example:

$users = User::all(); // 1 query

foreach ($users as $user) {
    echo $user->posts->count(); // 1 query per user!
}

-----------------------------

=> Eager Loading

Definition:

Loads the main model and related models together using with().

Optimizes the number of queries.

Example:
$users = User::with('posts')->get(); // 2 queries total

Query 1: Fetch all users

Query 2: Fetch all posts related to those users

----------------------------
=> Lazy Eager Loading

Definition:

Used when you already fetched the main models but decide to load related models later.

Uses the load() method.

Example:

$users = User::all(); // 1 query
$users->load('posts'); // 1 additional query for all posts


Total queries: 2

Similar efficiency to eager loading but applied after fetching models.

=> Real-Life Example

Lazy Loading: Going to the fridge every time you need a new ingredient while cooking — slow.

Eager Loading: Gather all ingredients at once before cooking — fast and efficient.

Lazy Eager Loading: Realize you need extra ingredients halfway, so fetch them all at once — still fast.
