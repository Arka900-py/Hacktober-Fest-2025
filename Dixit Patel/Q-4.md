## 4. Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.  
- Repeat the process until the number equals `1` (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include `1`.  
- Those numbers for which this process ends in `1` are happy.  

Return `true` if `n` is a happy number, and `false` if not.

### Example 1

**Input:**  
n = 19


**Output:**  
true


**Explanation:**  
- 1² + 9² = 82  
- 8² + 2² = 68  
- 6² + 8² = 100  
- 1² + 0² + 0² = 1

### Example 2

**Input:**  
n = 2


**Output:**  
false

Answer : 

Algorithm to Determine a Happy Number

Start with a positive integer n.

Initialize a set (or hash map) to track numbers we have already seen.

Repeat:

Replace n with the sum of the squares of its digits.

If n becomes 1, return true (happy number).

If n has been seen before (cycle detected), return false (not happy).

Continue until you reach 1 or detect a cycle.

Step-by-Step Example

n = 19

19 → 1² + 9² = 1 + 81 = 82

82 → 8² + 2² = 64 + 4 = 68

68 → 6² + 8² = 36 + 64 = 100

100 → 1² + 0² + 0² = 1  Happy number

n = 2

2 → 4

4 → 16

16 → 1 + 36 = 37

37 → 9 + 49 = 58

58 → 25 + 64 = 89

89 → 64 + 81 = 145

145 → 1 + 16 + 25 = 42

42 → 16 + 4 = 20

20 → 4 + 0 = 4  → Not happy
