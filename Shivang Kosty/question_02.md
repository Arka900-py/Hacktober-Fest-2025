Explain the difference between CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network).

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are both types of neural networks, but they are designed for different kinds of data.

A CNN is mainly used for spatial data like images. It processes data by applying filters that detect patterns such as edges, textures, or shapes. CNNs work well where nearby pixels or features are related, and they capture this local spatial structure through convolution layers. They do not keep track of previous inputs; they analyze the entire input at once.

An RNN, on the other hand, is designed for sequential data like text, speech, or time series. It processes data step by step and remembers previous information through internal memory. This allows it to understand context across time. However, standard RNNs can suffer from problems like vanishing gradients, which is why variants like LSTM and GRU are often used.

In simple terms, CNNs are best for images or grid-like data where space matters, while RNNs are best for sequences where order and context over time matter.
