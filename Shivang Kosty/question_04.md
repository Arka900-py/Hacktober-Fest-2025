What is the difference between classification and regression?

Classification and regression are two types of machine learning tasks, and the main difference lies in the type of output they predict.

In classification, the goal is to predict a category or label. The output is discrete, meaning it belongs to a specific class such as “spam” or “not spam,” “dog” or “cat,” or “positive,” “negative,” or “neutral.” Classification can be binary (two classes) or multi-class (more than two classes). The model learns patterns that help it decide which group a new input belongs to.

In regression, the goal is to predict a numerical or continuous value. Examples include predicting house prices, temperature, or salary. Instead of assigning a class, the model estimates a number based on the input features.

In simple terms, classification answers “Which category does this belong to?”, while regression answers “What is the value?”.
