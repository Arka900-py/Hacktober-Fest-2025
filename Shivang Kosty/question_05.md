What are decision trees, and how do they decide splits?

A decision tree is a machine learning model that makes predictions by splitting data into smaller groups based on feature values. It looks like a flowchart with nodes representing decisions and branches leading to outcomes. Each internal node asks a question about a feature (like “Is age > 30?”), and depending on the answer, the data is sent down different paths until it reaches a leaf node, which gives the final prediction.

To decide where to split, the tree evaluates all possible features and thresholds and chooses the one that best separates the data. For classification tasks, it usually uses measures like Gini impurity or Entropy. These metrics calculate how mixed the classes are in a group. A good split creates branches where each group is as pure as possible, meaning most samples in that group belong to the same class.

For regression tasks, decision trees use Mean Squared Error (MSE) or similar measures to find splits that reduce the variation in target values within each group.

In simple terms, a decision tree keeps asking the most useful questions to divide the data until it reaches a confident prediction.
