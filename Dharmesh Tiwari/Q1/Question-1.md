Question : What is the difference between verification and validation in software testing?
Answer : Verification is process that we assure that are we build the product right ?

=>This is developer side process . 
=>In simple words: “Are we building the product right?”

=>Verification means checking that the product is being built correctly.

=>It ensures that each stage of the software development process meets the specified requirements — before moving to the next stage.
=>It check every stage of testing Verification checks:

=>All of this happens before running the software — that’s verification.

=>Verification ensures the product is built correctly according to design and requirements — it focuses on the process rather than the final output.

=>It checks whether the software meets all specified requirements before moving to the next development phase.

=>Verification is a static process — it does not involve executing the code or running the software.

=>Main goal: To identify defects early in the development phase (before coding or testing).

=>Verification activities ensure that all deliverables are correct, complete, and consistent.

=>It helps in maintaining quality assurance throughout the software development lifecycle.

=>Common documents verified: SRS (Software Requirement Specification), design documents.

Validation : Verification is process that we assure that are we build the right product ?
This is QA side process.
=>In simple words: “Are we building the right product?”


=>Validation ensures the software meets user needs and expectations — it checks if we built the right product.

=>It is a dynamic process, meaning the software is actually executed and tested.

=>Validation is performed after coding, on the right side of the V-Model (during testing phases).

=>The main goal of validation is to confirm that the final system behaves as required by the customer.

=>It helps verify that the system functions correctly in real-world scenarios.

=>Validation activities include Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, and Acceptance Testing.

=>It is usually performed by testers and sometimes end-users.

=>Validation ensures the software is usable, reliable, and ready for deployment.

=>Functional and non-functional testing (like performance, usability, and security) are part of validation.

=>Validation helps find defects that occur when the system doesn’t meet user requirements even if the design was correct.

=>It ensures that all business and customer goals are fulfilled before the product release.

=>Validation gives confidence to stakeholders that the software works as expected in real use.

=>Validation cannot be done just by reading documents — it requires actual software execution.


Both come under v model where project devloped by developer and tested by tester at same duration of time . it is side by side process where developer and test both involve in same time .
