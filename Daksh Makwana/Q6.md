6. House Robber II
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.
All houses are arranged in a circle â€” the first house is the neighbor of the last one.
Adjacent houses have a security system connected; it will automatically alert the police if two adjacent houses are broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1
Input:

nums = [2,3,2]
Output:
3
Explanation:
You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and house 3 (money = 2) because they are adjacent.

Example 2
Input:

nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output:
4
Explanation:
Rob house 1 (money = 1) and house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount = 1 + 3 = 4.

Example 3
Input:

nums = [1,2,3]
Output:
3

### Solution

```php
<?php

function rob($nums) {
    $n = count($nums);
    if ($n == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    if ($n == 1) {
        return $nums[0];
    }

    // Scenario 1: Rob houses from 0 to n-2
    $rob1 = rob_linear(array_slice($nums, 0, $n - 1));

    // Scenario 2: Rob houses from 1 to n-1
    $rob2 = rob_linear(array_slice($nums, 1, $n - 1));

    return max($rob1, $rob2);
}

function rob_linear($nums) {
    $n = count($nums);
    if ($n == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    if ($n == 1) {
        return $nums[0];
    }

    $dp = array_fill(0, $n, 0);
    $dp[0] = $nums[0];
    $dp[1] = max($nums[0], $nums[1]);

    for ($i = 2; $i < $n; $i++) {
        $dp[$i] = max($dp[$i - 1], $dp[$i - 2] + $nums[$i]);
    }

    return $dp[$n - 1];
}

?>
```
