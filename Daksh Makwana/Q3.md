## 3. How does job chaining differ from job batching?  
Give a use case where batching is preferable.

**Job Chaining** links jobs together, so the next job in the chain starts only after the previous one finishes successfully. It's like a relay race where each runner has to wait for the one before them.

**Job Batching** runs a group of jobs at the same time and lets you do something (like send an email) when all of them are done. It's like starting a whole team of runners at once and waiting for everyone to cross the finish line.

**Use Case for Batching:**

Batching is great for processing a large number of independent tasks, like resizing thousands of images. You can throw them all into a batch, let them run in parallel, and then get a notification when the entire batch is complete. This is much faster than chaining, where each image would have to be processed one after the other.
