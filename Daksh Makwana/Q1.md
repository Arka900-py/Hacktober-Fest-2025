# 🛰️ Event Broadcasting in Laravel

## 🧠 What Is Event Broadcasting?

Event broadcasting in **Laravel** lets your app send **real-time updates** from the server (backend) to the browser (frontend).  
It’s used for features like:

- Chat messages 💬  
- Live notifications 🔔  
- Real-time dashboards 📊  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works (Step by Step)

1. **Create an Event**  
   Example: `php artisan make:event MessageSent`

2. **Enable Broadcasting**  
   In the event class, implement the `ShouldBroadcast` interface:
   ```php
   class MessageSent implements ShouldBroadcast
   {
       public function broadcastOn()
       {
           return new Channel('chat');
       }
   }
