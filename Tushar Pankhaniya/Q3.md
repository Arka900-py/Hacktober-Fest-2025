Flutter is all about widgets, but it also uses properties to customize them. They are related, but not the same.

ðŸ”¹ Widgets

Widgets are the building blocks of the UI in Flutter.

Everything you see on the screen (text, button, image, layout) is a widget.

Widgets describe what the UI should look like.

Example:

Text('Hello Flutter')


Here, Text is a widget that displays text on the screen.

ðŸ”¹ Properties

Properties are the attributes or settings of a widget.

They define how the widget behaves or looks.

Every widget has its own set of properties.

Example:

Text(
  'Hello Flutter',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, color: Colors.blue),
)


style is a property of the Text widget.

fontSize and color are properties of TextStyle.
