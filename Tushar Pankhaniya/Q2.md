### An array and a list both store multiple values in a single variable, but they differ slightly depending on the language.

In TypeScript

An array is used to store multiple values of the same type.
It’s indexed, and each element can be accessed using its position.

let numbers: number[] = [10, 20, 30, 40];
console.log(numbers[1]);


Arrays are usually homogeneous (same data type).

Size can be modified, but structure stays simple.

In Dart

Dart doesn’t use arrays; it uses Lists, which work in a similar way but are more flexible.

```
List<int> numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40];
print(numbers[1]); // Output: 20
```

You can easily modify lists:

```
numbers.add(50);
print(numbers);
```

Lists can be fixed-length or growable, depending on how you create them.

In short:
- TypeScript : uses Arrays for collections
- Dart : uses Lists (similar to arrays but more dynamic)
