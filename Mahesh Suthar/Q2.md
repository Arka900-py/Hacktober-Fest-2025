## 2. What is the difference between singleton and scoped binding in the service container?

In Laravel's Service Container, both `singleton` and `scoped` are used to control how objects are created and shared. The main difference is the **lifetime** of the object instance.

To put it simply:
- **Singleton:** One instance for the entire application's life.
- **Scoped:** One instance for a specific lifecycle, like a single web request or a single queued job.

Let's break it down.

### Singleton Binding

A `singleton` binding tells the container to create an object **only once**. The very first time you ask for it, the container creates a new instance. After that, every single time you ask for that same object anywhere in your application, you will get the **exact same instance** back.

**Analogy:** Think of a `singleton` as the key to the main office. The first person to arrive gets the key. Anyone else who needs to get into the office gets that same, single key. There is only one.

**When to use it:**
- For objects that are expensive to create (like a complex service or a database connection).
- For objects that need to maintain a global state across the entire application request (like a configuration manager).

**Example:**
```php
// In a Service Provider
$this->app->singleton(MyApplicationService::class, function ($app) {
    // This function only runs ONCE.
    return new MyApplicationService();
});
```

### Scoped Binding

A `scoped` binding is more specialized. It tells the container to create an object **only once per request** (or per job in a queue).

The first time you ask for it during a request, a new instance is created. Any other time you ask for it *within that same request*, you get the same instance back. However, as soon as a new web request hits your application, the container will forget the old instance and create a brand new one.

**Analogy:** Think of a `scoped` instance as a hotel room key card. It gives you access to the same room for the entire duration of your stay (the request). When you check out and a new guest arrives (a new request), they get a fresh key card for their own stay.

**When to use it:**
- This is especially useful in long-running applications like **Laravel Octane** or queue workers.
- When you have a service that needs to maintain a state for a single request, but that state should be reset for the next request to prevent data leaks.

**Example:**
```php
// In a Service Provider
$this->app->scoped(MyRequestSpecificData::class, function ($app) {
    // This function runs once PER REQUEST.
    return new MyRequestSpecificData();
});
```
